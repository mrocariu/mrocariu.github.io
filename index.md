I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [ETHZ](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), in the Institute for Transportation and Planing ([IVT](http://www.ivt.ethz.ch/index_EN)) under the supervision of [Dr. Mónica Menéndez](http://www.ivt.ethz.ch/people/mmenendez/index_EN).
<br/>  
<br/>

On December 2015 I defended my PhD Thesis entitled: "Improving Urban Deliveries via Collaboration"
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

While performing my PhD I worked at [CENIT](http://cenit.upc.edu/), where I participated in several research applied projects.<br/>
<br/>

I would like to stay on the research side of industry oriented problems.
I specially like to work with OR tools on transportation problems, but open to new fields. <br/>
<br/>

Website always being improved :)
