I am a Research Associate at the [Institute of Data Analysis and Process Design](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/idp/) of the [Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW)](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/).

<br/>

Before, I was a Scientific Collaborator of the [Learning Lab](https://www.sccer-mobility.ch/capacity-areas/Learning-Lab/) of the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research Efficient Technologies and Systems for Mobility ([SCCER Mobility](https://www.sccer-mobility.ch/)). And before that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at [ETHZ](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html), in the Institute for Transportation and Planing ([IVT](http://www.ivt.ethz.ch/index_EN)) under the supervision of [Dr. MÃ³nica MenÃ©ndez](http://www.ivt.ethz.ch/people/mmenendez/index_EN). 
Between 2017 and 2019 I was funded by the [Hasler Foundation](https://haslerstiftung.ch/), and I developed a project about Connected and automated technology changing urban logistics ([CALog](https://www.ivt.ethz.ch/en/svt/projects/calog.html)).

<br/>

On December 2015 I defended my PhD Thesis entitled: "Improving Urban Deliveries via Collaboration".

While performing my PhD I worked at [CENIT](http://www.cenit.es/), where I participated in several research applied projects.<br/>
<br/>

I would like to stay on the research side of industry oriented problems.
I specially like to work with OR tools on transportation problems, but open to new fields. <br/>
